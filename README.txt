If you have a full site and a separate mobile site, using this "mobile-full.js" will detect your mobile visitors and redirect them to your mobile site, but it will also allow them to go back to the full site as long as you use the link in the "link for mobile site" file. Modify as needed! 

Note, you WILL need to add the links for your full and mobile sites into the JS file on lines 140, 145, 146 and 165
